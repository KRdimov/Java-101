## This repository stores my code for the tasks that I solved throughout the weeks of the course

The course details can be found [here](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Java-2016).

> Note: There are still tasks that I have not finished solving and I still need to add description to most of the tasks.
>
> Note: Packages that include "_code_improvements" include the same tasks from the week but the solutions are rewritten there by me at a later stage
